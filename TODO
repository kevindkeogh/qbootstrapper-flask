2. add qbootstrapper to pypi
3. add market data to the database in some structured schema
4. add instrument-definition, which would be linked to a convention and an
	id, which itself would be linked to a database id. Can't do this until
	there's some more thought about how I should put the market data
	in the database
5. add curve-definition, contains instrument-definitions
